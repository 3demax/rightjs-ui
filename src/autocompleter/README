Events
======
  
  Autocompleter might notify you about the following events
  
 * show    - when the list of suggestions is shown
 * hide    - when the list of suggestions is hidden
 * update  - when the list of suggestions was updated
 * load    - when the xhr request is loaded
 * select  - when some option was selected
 * done    - when the option was copied to the input element


Url Specifying
========

Right autocompleter provides two options to work with the target urls, you might
specify the 'param' and 'url' options as the default and usual approach.

new Autocompleter('my-input', {
  url: '/my/url',
  param: 'search'
});

In this case the autocompleter will hit urls like this.

/my/url?param=a
/my/url?param=as
/my/url?param=asd
/my/url?param=asdf

You also might want to have more caching friendly urls without the parameters
in this case you might use the '%{search}' placeholder in your url. Like this

new Autocompleter('my-input', {
  url: '/my/url/%{search}.js'
});

In this case the autocompleter will hit urls like this

/my/url/a.js
/my/url/as.js
/my/url/asd.js
/my/url/asdf.js

Which might be easier and more effectively cached on the server side


Auto-Discovery Feature
======================

As all the other widgets out of the RightJS UI library the autocompleters
have ability to be automatically discovered and initialized. For that 
purpose you might use a 'rel' attribute like this.

<input type="text" rel="autocompleter[/your/url/goes/here]" />

You also might define a local options list like this

<input type="text" rel="autocompleter['mommy', 'daddy', 'sonny']"/>
