Right Lightbox
==============

Right Lightbox is a lightbox widget that implemented using the RightJS library


Whats up?
=================

 * Support of any html content displaying
 * Content loading via ajax requests
 * Road trips support
 * Content auto discovery via the rel="lightbox" attribute
 * Tiny size, no image dependencies, fully css based design
 * Everything gets included in a single file


API-Reference
=====

Right Lightbox has a really simple and short api

 * hide - hides the lightbox
 * show(mixed content[, Object sizes]) - show the content
 * load(String url[, Object options]) - load the content via ajax

You can have those methods at any instances like that

new Lightbox().show('my stuff');

or at the class level

Lightbox.show('my stuff');

You can send dom elements in the 'show' methods, or a nodes-list
or an array of nodes, anything you need.

Lightbox.show($('my-element'));
Lightbox.show($('my-element').innerHTML);
Lightbox.show(['this', 'that', 'and those']);

If you send a link node to the 'show' method then Lightbox will
automatically load the content from the url address it refers to
and set the title from the link

<a href="the/address.html" title="My Link" id="my-link">My Link</a>

Lightbox.show($('my-link')); // this will load the 'the/address.html'

Options
=======

When you instance a new lightbox object, you can pass the following options

 * fxDuration - the visual effects duration (200 ms by default)
 * hideOnEsc  - if set false, won't let the user to close the lightbox by the Esc button
 * showCloseButton - if set false, won't show the close button
 * blockContent - if set true, then all the displayed content will be hovered
                with a transparent div and won't be clickable.


Links auto discovery
====================

In similarity to the Lightbox 2 project, you can specify the 'rel'
attribute of your links and those links will be automatically hooked
to be shown through the lightbox.

<a href="image1.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img src="image1-thmb.jpg" /></a>
<a href="image2.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img src="image2-thmb.jpg" /></a>

Use the attribute rel="lightbox[roadtrip]" if need the ligthbox to show
the 'next' and 'prev' buttons so the user could see all your images without
closing the lightbox
