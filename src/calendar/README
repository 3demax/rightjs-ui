API-Reference
=============

The API of the calendar is fairly simple

 * setDate(date) - the date might be a Date instance or a String
 * getDate()     - returns the current date
 * format()      - returns a string representation of the selected date
 * insertTo(element) - makes the calendar inlined into the element
 * assignTo(element[, trigger]) - assigns the calendar to auto appear
 * show()        - shows the calendar block
 * hide()        - hides the calendar block

Options
=======

There is a simple list of options. You might pass them into the constructor
or alter the Calendar.Options variable to make the changes globally

 * format   - one of the predefined formats name or a format string
 * showTime - a marker if the time picker should be displayed 
 * showButtons - a marker if the bottom buttons should be displayed
 * minDate     - the minimum date you can select
 * maxDate     - the maximum date you can select
 * firstDay    - 1 for Monday (default), 0 for Sunday
 * numberOfMonths - a number of month to display (default 1), or a [x,y] monthes greed definition
 * fxDuration  - the visual effects duration (if Fx is available)


Formats
=======

Right calendar uses the GNU strftime dates formatting system, same as in
C/Ruby/Python/etc languages.

There are few predefined, most used formats also available

 * ISO    %Y-%m-%d
 * POSIX  %Y/%m/%d
 * EUR    %d-%m-%Y
 * US     %m/%d/%Y


Inputs Auto-Discovery
=====================

You don't need to manually instance and associate calendars with your
input elements on the page. Instead of that you can just define the
rel="calendar" attribute and when the page loaded Right Calendar
will automatically find the elements and associate them with calendars.

<input type="text" name="dead_at" rel="calendar" />

Additionally, you can initiate an input-trigger pair. So that the
calendar block will pop up only by clicking at the trigger element.
For that feature you need to specify the rel attribute like this
rel="calendar[input-id]"

<input type="text" name="dead_at" id="dead_at" />
<img src="/images/calendar.png" rel="calendar[dead_at]" />


Internationalization
====================

There is an object associated to the Calendar.i18n attribute. You can
reassing/alter it with values in your language, or you can pass an
optional 'i18n' key with the constructor options to make a particular
calendar be in a particular language.
